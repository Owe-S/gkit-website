# WIREFRAME MODE – TEMPORARY DESIGN-ONLY RULESET

## Scope
This ruleset applies ONLY during the initial wireframe and layout setup phase.

Once the wireframe structure is approved or marked as complete,
ALL restrictions defined in this document are automatically lifted.

---

## ACTIVE PHASE: WIREFRAME MODE (TEMPORARY)

While WIREFRAME MODE is active, the AI must follow these rules:

### 1. Purpose
The goal is to define **visual structure only**:
- Layout
- Spacing
- Sections
- Grids
- Component hierarchy
- Light-mode visual expression (Clean Pro)

Content meaning is NOT part of this phase.

---

### 2. Content Handling (STRICT – TEMPORARY)
During WIREFRAME MODE:

- Do NOT rewrite, improve, analyze, or optimize real content
- Do NOT infer meaning or business logic
- Do NOT introduce real product names, services, or data
- Use placeholders ONLY:
  - Title Placeholder
  - Subtitle Placeholder
  - Text Placeholder
  - Button Placeholder
  - Image Placeholder
  - Icon Placeholder

Content is considered **locked**, layout is **modifiable**.

---

### 3. Design Constraints
- Light mode only
- Minimalist / Clean Pro style
- Mobile-first structure
- Short vertical sections
- Neutral colors (white / gray / soft blue)
- Cards, grids, and simple components

---

### 4. Code Generation Rules
If code is generated during WIREFRAME MODE:
- Preserve existing real content exactly as-is
- Only placeholders may be added where content is required
- Focus on HTML/CSS/layout structure, not wording

---

### 5. Decision Rule
If there is uncertainty:
→ Always modify layout  
→ Never modify content

---

## EXIT CONDITION – IMPORTANT

### 6. Wireframe Completion
When the user indicates any of the following:
- "Wireframe approved"

- "Wireframe done"
- "Exit wireframe mode"
- "Proceed with content"
- Or starts asking for copy/content changes

Then:

▶ WIREFRAME MODE IS DISABLED  
▶ ALL CONTENT RESTRICTIONS ARE REMOVED  
▶ Normal content generation, rewriting, optimization and expansion is fully allowed

No further limitations apply unless explicitly re-enabled.

---

## Re-entry
Wireframe Mode can ONLY be re-enabled by explicit user instruction.
